# Docker Connector

Super simple utility that facilities direct-to-bash with a Docker container running in ECS.

## Download

Boldly assuming anyone that needs this has homebrew already installed.

```
curl -L https://github.com/ykag/docker-connector/releases/latest/download/docker-connector -o /opt/homebrew/bin/docker-connector && chmod +x /opt/homebrew/bin/docker-connector
```
